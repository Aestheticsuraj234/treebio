# Username Suggestion Function Breakdown

## Function Declaration
```javascript
export async function getAvailableUsernameSuggestions(base: string, count = 3, maxTries = 10) {
```
**What it does:** 
- Declares an `async` function (can wait for database operations)
- Takes 3 parameters:
  - `base`: the starting username (like "john")
  - `count`: how many suggestions to return (default: 3)
  - `maxTries`: maximum attempts to find usernames (default: 10)

---

## Initialize Storage
```javascript
const suggestions: string[] = [];
```
**What it does:** 
- Creates an empty array to store the available usernames we find
- TypeScript notation `: string[]` means it only holds strings

---

## Main Loop
```javascript
for (let i = 1; suggestions.length < count && i < maxTries; i++) {
```
**What it does:** 
- Starts a loop with counter `i = 1`
- Continues while BOTH conditions are true:
  - We haven't found enough suggestions yet (`suggestions.length < count`)
  - We haven't exceeded our attempt limit (`i < maxTries`)
- Increments `i` after each attempt

---

## Generate Username Candidate
```javascript
const candidate = `${base}${i}`;
```
**What it does:** 
- Creates a potential username by combining the base with the current number
- Example: if `base = "john"` and `i = 1`, then `candidate = "john1"`

---

## Check Database
```javascript
const exists = await db.user.findUnique({ where: { username: candidate } });
```
**What it does:** 
- Searches the database to see if this username already exists
- `await` pauses the function until the database responds
- Returns the user record if found, or `null` if not found

---

## Add to Suggestions
```javascript
if (!exists) suggestions.push(candidate);
```
**What it does:** 
- If the username doesn't exist in the database (`!exists` means "not exists")
- Adds the available username to our suggestions array

---

## Return Results
```javascript
return suggestions;
```
**What it does:** 
- Returns the array of available usernames we found

---

## Example Usage

If you call `getAvailableUsernameSuggestions("sarah", 3)`:

1. **Try "sarah1"** → Check database → If available, add to suggestions
2. **Try "sarah2"** → Check database → If available, add to suggestions  
3. **Try "sarah3"** → Check database → If available, add to suggestions
4. **Continue until** we have 3 suggestions OR we've tried 10 times

**Possible result:** `["sarah1", "sarah3", "sarah7"]` (if "sarah2" was taken)

## Key Features

- **Smart stopping**: Stops when it finds enough suggestions, doesn't waste time
- **Prevents infinite loops**: Won't try forever if most usernames are taken
- **Efficient**: Only checks database for usernames that might work
- **Flexible**: You can customize how many suggestions and how many attempts
